## Voice Operated Wheelchair  

This project focuses on enhancing mobility for individuals with disabilities by integrating voice command technology into a wheelchair. Using an **Arduino microcontroller**, a **Bluetooth module**, and **motor drivers**, the system allows users to control the wheelchair with simple voice commands such as "forward," "backward," "left," and "right."  

The **Bluetooth module** connects to a smartphone, where the userâ€™s voice is converted into commands. These commands are processed by the **Arduino**, which then controls the **DC motors** to move the wheelchair accordingly. The system ensures smooth and precise movements, making it easy to operate.  

This project provides an **affordable and user-friendly** alternative to traditional joystick-controlled or expensive smart wheelchairs. Future enhancements could include multi-language support, obstacle detection, and solar-powered charging for sustainability.
